        - question: What is the ARM Architecture?
          answer: |
            The ARM Architecture broadly refers to a set of reduced instructions for 
            computers to run. This Architecture was created by Arm Holdings, and 
            they licence this for equipment manufacturers like QualComm, Apple, to make
            processors based on the architecture.
        - question: Why ARM?
          answer: |
            The ARM Achitecture has the advantage of having a reduced instruction set, 
            which allows for higher performance and energy efficiency. They have traditionally
            been used in your Phones, TVs and small devices for that very reason. Recently,
            they have also been coming to larger devices like laptops, which have traditionally
            relied on the older x64 architecture.

        - question: |
            What is the "Neutral" Architecture?
          answer: |
            Some applications use a runtime/interpreter, i.e. .NET, JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Node etc. As such, 
            some developers may opt to list their application as Neutral, which means you have to install the runtime
            to run the app. Most runtimes have ARM/ARM64 support, which means the app will most likely run on ARM.
