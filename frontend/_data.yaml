      Where did you get this data?
    id: data-source
    answer: |
      The data is taken from Microsoft's Default Winget Package Directory, you can find it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/).
      The data source is refreshed automatically around twice a day, and the source code for this site can be found on
      GitHub [here](https://github.com/Jyodann/woar/). Note that the data comes from developer provided information,
      and may not be fully representative of ARM Support for that software.
  - question: |
      What is the "Neutral" Architecture?
    id: neutral
    answer: |
      Some applications use a runtime/interpreter, i.e. .NET, JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Node etc. As such, 
      some developers may opt to list their application as Neutral, which means you have to install the runtime
      to run the app. Most runtimes have ARM/ARM64 support, which means the app will most likely run on ARM.
  - question: What is the ARM Architecture?
    id: whatisarm
    answer: |
      The ARM Architecture broadly refers to a set of reduced instructions for 
      computers to run. This Architecture was created by Arm Holdings, and 
      they licence this for equipment manufacturers like QualComm, Apple, to make
      processors based on the architecture.
  - question: Why ARM?
    id: whyarm
    answer: |
      The ARM Achitecture has the advantage of having a reduced instruction set, 
      which allows for higher performance and energy efficiency. They have traditionally
      been used in your Phones, TVs and small devices for that very reason. Recently,
      they have also been coming to larger devices like laptops, which have traditionally
            relied on the older x64 architecture.
